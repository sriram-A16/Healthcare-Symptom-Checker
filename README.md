## Running the Application

You need to have both the backend and frontend servers running simultaneously in two separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * From the `backend` directory, run:
        ```bash
        node index.js
        ```
    * The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Application:**
    * From the `frontend` directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * The React development server will open a new tab in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can now use the application by entering symptoms in the text area and submitting the form.
